### Lab1

Program implements Bellman-Ford algorithm to find shortest path in graph with possible negative edges weights. Moreover the algorithm detects negative cycles in algorithm (in such case reports impossibility of finding shortest path)

To compile: `g++ lab1.cpp -o <executable_file>`

To run: `<executable_file>`
and then choose which input format is used - list of edges (start_node, end_node, weight) or neghbourhood matrix.
